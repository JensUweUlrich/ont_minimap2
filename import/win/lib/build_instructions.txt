zlib
-----
Comes with MinKNOW libraries, see there. Re-building together with the other
libraries is not absolutely necessary, but desirable when the compiler version
changes. MSVC links to a runtime library that is specific to the compiler
version (currently msvcrt140.dll), and in best case all our libraries should
use the same runtime.


pthread
-------
* in Git Bash:
  git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/pthreads4w/code pthreads4w
* In MSVC Developer Command Prompt, pthread directory:
  "c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
  nmake clean VC
  nmake clean VC-debug
* copy resulting dll and lib files and the following header files:
  pthread.h
  sched.h
  semaphore.h
